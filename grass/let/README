=== Glid: Grass/Let Interpreter and Decompiler (version 0.080914) ==

* What is Glid?
 Glid is yet another Grass interpreter which can: 
  + execute Grass and Let programs,
  + tranlate a Let program into a Grass program, and
  + tranlate a Grass program into a Let program.


* What is the Grass language?
 Grass is a functional grass-planting programming language
 developed by Katsuhiro Ueno. 
 See http://www.blue.sky.or.jp/grass/ for detail.


* What is the Let language?
 + It is a human-readable/writable functional language.
 + You can write a program in functional style.
 + The Let program ranges over 'Prog' in the following syntax:

    Prog := Def*
    Def := let Var Var* = Exp
    Exp := Var  |  Exp Exp  |  let Var = Exp in Exp  |  Exp; Exp
    Var := In  |  Out  |  Succ  |  W  |  [_a-zA-Z0-9]+

  The semantics is omitted since it is trivial.
  The special variable name "_" is used for dummy variables.
  You can insert comments between "(*" and "*)"
  or from "//" to the end of the line.


* What are requirements to install the Glid?
 + Objective Caml: version 3.08.02 or later.


* How can we build the Glid?
   Just type "make" to build the program "glid.bin".
   If you have native code compiler for Objective Caml,
   try "make opt" to build "glid.opt".


* How can we use it?
   Assume that the name of the built program is 'glid'
   (which may be glid.bin or glid.opt).
   The name of a Grass and Let program must have the suffix
   '.grass' and '.let', resp.
   
   To run a Grass program, 
    $ glid program.grass

   To run a Let program,
    $ glid program.let

   To translate a Let program into a Grass program,
    $ glid program.let -o program.grass

   To translate a Let program into a Grass program
   and output it to the standard output,
    $ glid program.let -

   To translate a Grass program into a Let program,
    $ glid program.grass -o program.let

   To translate a Grass program into a Let program
   and output it to the standard output,
    $ glid program.grass -

   To get an unkind usage,
    $ glid -h
   or invoke it with illegal options.


* Are there any sample programs?
   You will find in the 'samples' directory.
   Note that it may contain hints for golfers:-).


* What is the licence of the distribution?
   GPLv2 or later.
